By the time he turned 12, he was playing the mandolin professionally with Carin Mari & Pony Express, performing widely in the United States for 11 years. Colin was responsible for meeting all of the band's sound needs both on stage and in the studio. He served as the principal recording and mixing engineer for 4 of the bands albums. Colin attended and graduated from the Recording Workshop in Chillicothe, OH. He holds a Bachelor's of Arts degree in Theatre Arts, and in 2014, he earned his Master of Fine Arts degree in sound design from the Savannah College of Art and Design, graduating with the highest honors, as [Presidential Medalist][0].

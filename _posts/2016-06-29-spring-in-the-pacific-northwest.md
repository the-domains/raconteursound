  Spring in the Pacific Northwest is a collection a natural ambiences from
  Oregon and Washington. It features temperate forests, lakes, fields, ocean,
  thunderstorms, and rain. All files were recorded MidSide, and are unencoded
  for maximum flexibility of stereo width. Beautiful birdcalls, breezy forests,
  soothing rain, and crashing waves give you a wonderfully lush and vivid tool
  set.
